# Virtual Foraging with R

A short vignette on using RSelenium to scrape image data from the web in R.
See https://bwlewis.github.io/virtual_foraging/ for example output.

See the `virtual_foraging.rmd` file for the markdown document, which
loads example data in `bounty.rdata`. You can set the `{r, eval=FALSE}`
markdown settings to `{r, eval=TRUE}` to generate your own output
markdown file, or simply copy and paste the R code and evaluate it in
an R session.

I took the morel photo in April, 2019 somewhere in Ohio...
